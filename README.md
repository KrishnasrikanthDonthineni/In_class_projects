Under Graduate: -  Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science And Engineering, JNTUK, India.
I worked on different projects from Under Graduate. Some of them are 
The project I worked in the last semester. In this project I have mainly concentrated on the backend process rather than front-end. The time taken to build this project is less than 30 days.
1)E-Commerce Web Site

2)Database Design From Scratch this project is done during the first semester in which database is created from scratch using MySQL. Also Created Entity Relationship Diagram, Database Relation Diagram to explain how data flows in the database.
3) Towards Detecting Compromised Accounts On Social Networks ( IEEE Paper )   Final project that I worked in Under Graduate . In this i Developed a twitter proto type to implement the detecting methods to discover the compromised accounts. Used NetBeans IDE 8.2 to integrate computation and programming . Used JSP,HTML and CSS for web development. MYSQL for the database. 
4)  Android Application Development (Mini Project in UnderGraduate)   which   I worked out of own interest in android development. Created simple Android application to play the inbuilt videos and connected to a database to get the users details.

           The things which I am going to learn during this course is going to be beneficial to me in couple of ways. Firstly, As I am going to attend many interviews for the internship after this semester, the learning I am going to get in this course will be useful for me to present myself in a more stronger position to crack the interview. Secondly, This course is going to help me work better on my own projects. Finally, I believe this course is going to be more challenging yet more rewarding one to increase my knowledge in Full stack development.
